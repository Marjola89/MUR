\title{Compute NN list and voronoi area.}
\usage{
create_nnlist_area(data_dir, organ, dpl)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_dir}{is the path of the data directory were the matrices X and Y for the model are saved.}

\item{organ}{is the organ segmentation e.g. liver, spleen, kidney_left etc.}

\item{dpl}{is a list describing the structure of the dummy points to be added to the data being triangulated.
e.g. list(ndx = 5, ndy = 5). If the argument is 'NULL' then no dummy point is added to the data.
ndx: The x-dimension of a rectangular grid; if either ndx or ndy is null, no grid is constructed.
ndy: The y-dimension of the aforementioned rectangular grid.}
